## Problem Statement
This will be a project to facilitate community based dining.  It is based on a simple concept - no food should go to waste.  This will be accomplished by creating community based potlucks.  It will follow a concept similar to AirBnb where someone will host the potluck and multiple customers can participate. 

Our system of food consumption is inefficient.  
* Ingredients purchased at grocery stores go to waste because they are past their expiry date.
* Grocery stores sell in bulk and this propagates waste, especially for small households that cook and cannot use all ingredients in time.
* Cooking for one or two people is time consuming and can be exhausting for busy people.
* Eating out routinely is expensive.
* Many people eat alone, when this could be a great opportunity to network and meet people and foster community building.

This project has two parts:
* An app that will allow individuals (hosts) to cook for multiple people and host the potluck.  The host will pick a venue and list what they will be bringing.  The host can either then suggest that customers bring an item or pay the host a fee to participate.
* An app that will allow individuals (customers) to find hosts who are sponsoring events they want to attend.  The customer can participate either by agreeing to bring an item or paying the host.

Similar to AirBnb, there will be ratings to associate hosts and customers so a reputation can be built.
